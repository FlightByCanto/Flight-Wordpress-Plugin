Pull in photos, images and graphics from your Flight instance.

== Description ==

Pull in photos, images, and any other web-safe graphic file format from your Flight account directly into Wordpress.

You can browse your Library using the Folder and Album tree menu to quickly find files. Or use the Global Search to find exactly what you need by searching within filenames, descriptions, comments, keywords, tags, and even the person who uploaded it.

Once you locate your image file, simply select it to bring up the familiar, native Wordpress image attachment. Select your size, alignment and link options. The image alt tag will be auto-populated with file information for you. As the image is being inserted into post, it will be saved locally to your Wordpress Media library. This will ensure it is indexed by Google for SEO within your permalink structure, and also saved with your website backup and CDN processes.
